        \item \textbf{Pythagoras (ca. 550 b.c.)} showed that \textbf{numbers and geometry} underlie natural phenomena.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{1.2 Observing the Sky}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Night sky \textbf{changes} constantly:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stars move east to west nightly.
        \item Different stars/constellations appear each season.
        \item The Moon changes position and phase.
        \item Planets (``wandering stars'') display more complex motions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{1.3 The Geocentric Universe}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Plato (ca. 350 b.c.)}: Proposed a \textbf{fixed Earth} at the center, with stars on a \textbf{celestial sphere} rotating around it.
    \item Emphasized \textbf{uniform circular motion} as the ``perfect'' form for heavenly bodies.
    \item \textbf{Celestial Sphere}:  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Imaginary sphere with stars fixed on it, rotating about Earth’s \textbf{north celestial pole} and \textbf{south celestial pole}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{1.4 Retrograde Motion}

        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Ptolemy (ca. a.d. 100)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Refined epicycle system with \textbf{equants} (off-center points ensuring constant angular speed).
            \item \textbf{Geocentric} but increasingly complex; still became the standard model for $\sim$1500 years.
        \end{itemize}

\section*{Questions and Answers}

Below are possible questions (Q) and detailed answers (A). Use them to test yourself.

\hrulefill

\subsection*{1. General History}

\textbf{Q1.} What evidence do we have of early cultures studying the sky (before the Greeks), and why do we say the modern approach began with the Greeks?

\textbf{A1.}\\
- \textbf{Evidence} of early astronomical interest includes sites like \textbf{Stonehenge} (aligned with solstices) and the \textbf{Mayan and Aztec} temples (aligned with equinoxes/planetary events), as well as \textbf{Native American} medicine wheels.\\
- These show \textbf{observations} and attempts to \textbf{predict} celestial events.\\
- However, the \textbf{Greek tradition} introduced \textbf{mathematical} and \textbf{geometric} frameworks (e.g., Pythagoras’s emphasis on numbers), which is why we say \textbf{modern scientific astronomy}---with hypothesis, geometry, and logical models---starts there.

\subsection*{2. Key Greek Figures}

\textbf{Q2.} What were \textbf{Pythagoras’s} and \textbf{Hipparchus’s} contributions to understanding nature and the cosmos?

\textbf{A2.}\\
- \textbf{Pythagoras (ca. 550 b.c.)}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrated the \textbf{fundamental relationship} between \textbf{numbers and nature} (e.g., musical scales, right-angle geometry).
    \item Influenced the idea that the universe can be described using \textbf{mathematics}.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Hipparchus (ca. 150 b.c.)}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Invented epicycles} to explain retrograde motion.
    \item Created the first \textbf{star catalog} and devised a \textbf{magnitude system} for star brightness still in use (albeit modified) today.
    \item Advanced \textbf{trigonometry} to enable precise astronomical calculations.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Geocentric vs. Heliocentric}

\textbf{Q3.} Summarize \textbf{Plato’s} geocentric view and how \textbf{Copernicus} changed the fundamental assumption.

\textbf{A3.}\\
- \textbf{Plato’s View (350 b.c.)}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Earth is \textbf{fixed} at the center.
    \item The \textbf{celestial sphere} (with stars) rotates around Earth in a \textbf{perfect circle} at a \textbf{uniform speed}.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Copernicus’s Change}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Placed the \textbf{Sun} at the center.
    \item Earth and the other planets orbit \textbf{around} the Sun, challenging the 2000-year-old tradition of a stationary Earth.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Retrograde Motion}

\textbf{Q4.} What is \textbf{retrograde motion}, and how did the \textbf{Ptolemaic} model vs. the \textbf{Copernican} model explain it?

\textbf{A4.}\\
- \textbf{Retrograde Motion}: The apparent \textbf{backward} (westward) motion of a planet relative to the stars (instead of the usual eastward drift) over weeks or months.\\
- \textbf{Ptolemaic Explanation}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Used \textbf{epicycles} (small circles) on \textbf{larger deferents} and an off-center \textbf{equant}.
    \item As the planet moves on its epicycle, it can appear to go backward from Earth’s perspective.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Copernican Explanation}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Retrograde occurs when \textbf{Earth (on an inner, faster orbit)} overtakes the \textbf{slower} outer planet, causing a temporary backward shift in the line of sight.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Copernican Model}

\textbf{Q5.} Why are Mercury and Venus called \textbf{inferior planets}, and how does the Copernican model explain their limited angular separation from the Sun?

\textbf{A5.}\\
- \textbf{Inferior planets} are those that \textbf{orbit closer} to the Sun than Earth (i.e., \textbf{inside} Earth’s orbit).\\
- Because of their \textbf{inner orbits}, Mercury and Venus can never appear very far from the Sun in Earth’s sky:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mercury’s maximum angular separation is $\sim 28^\circ$.
    \item Venus’s maximum angular separation is $\sim 47^\circ$.
  \end{itemize}
- In the \textbf{Copernican model}, their orbits around the Sun are \textbf{smaller} than Earth’s, so from Earth’s perspective, they’re always in roughly the same \textbf{general direction} as the Sun.

\subsection*{6. Observational Configurations}

\textbf{Q6.} Define \textbf{opposition}, \textbf{conjunction}, and \textbf{greatest elongation}. Which planets can exhibit \textbf{opposition}, and why?

\textbf{A6.}\\
- \textbf{Opposition}: A planet (or object) is at an angular separation of \textbf{180$^\circ$} from the Sun (i.e., on the \textbf{opposite} side of the sky from the Sun when viewed from Earth).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Only superior planets} (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.) can be in opposition, because they \textbf{orbit outside} Earth’s orbit.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Conjunction}: Two bodies (e.g., planet and Sun) line up at the \textbf{same} right ascension or ecliptic longitude in the sky.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inferior conjunction}: Inferior planet is \textbf{between} Earth and Sun.
    \item \textbf{Superior conjunction}: Inferior planet is \textbf{behind} the Sun relative to Earth, or a superior planet lies on the far side of the Sun.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Greatest elongation}: The maximum angular separation of an \textbf{inferior planet} from the Sun (either East or West).

\subsection*{7. Synodic vs. Sidereal Periods}

\textbf{Q7.} Differentiate between \textbf{synodic} and \textbf{sidereal} periods, and explain the relationship 
\[
\frac{1}{S} = \Bigl|\frac{1}{P_\oplus} - \frac{1}{P}\Bigr|.
\]

\textbf{A7.}\\
- \textbf{Sidereal Period (P)}: The time it takes a planet to complete \textbf{one full orbit} relative to the \textbf{background stars}.\\
- \textbf{Synodic Period (S)}: The time between \textbf{recurrent alignments} of a planet with Earth and the Sun (e.g., from opposition to opposition).\\
- \textbf{Relationship}:
  \[
    \frac{1}{S} = \Bigl|\frac{1}{P_\oplus} - \frac{1}{P}\Bigr|
  \]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $P_\oplus$ is Earth’s sidereal period ($\sim 365.256$ days).
    \item The synodic period is \textbf{shorter or longer} than the sidereal period because \textbf{Earth} itself is also orbiting the Sun.
    \item This formula essentially says the \textbf{relative orbital motion} of Earth and the other planet determines how often they line up again in the sky.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{8. Paradigm Shifts}

\textbf{Q8.} What role did \textbf{Thomas Kuhn’s} idea of scientific revolutions play in understanding the move from a geocentric to a heliocentric model, and why was Copernicus’s proposal so controversial?

\textbf{A8.}\\
- \textbf{Kuhn’s Idea}: A paradigm is not just a theory but a way of \textbf{seeing} the entire universe.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Geocentrism was a \textbf{long-standing paradigm}; all observations and theories were interpreted within that framework for $\sim 2000$ years.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Controversy}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shifting to heliocentrism required \textbf{abandoning} the old, deeply held belief that Earth was the center of all creation---a core part of both \textbf{scientific} and \textbf{religious} doctrine.
    \item Challenged the authority of the Church, which had embraced geocentrism.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{9. ``Perfect'' Assumptions}

\textbf{Q9.} What ``perfect'' assumptions did the ancient Greeks and even Copernicus hold onto, and how did this limit accurate predictions?

\textbf{A9.}\\
- They insisted on \textbf{uniform circular motion} (perfect circles, constant speeds) because circles were seen as the most \textbf{perfect} shape.\\
- \textbf{Reality}: Planetary orbits are \textbf{elliptical} (Kepler’s later discovery) and speeds vary.\\
- By clinging to perfect circles, even Copernicus had to include \textbf{extra epicycles}, so his system, while simpler than Ptolemy’s overall, wasn’t fully \textbf{accurate}.

\subsection*{10. Personal Synthesis}

\textbf{Q10.} How would you explain the Copernican Revolution in simple terms, and what is the most important takeaway from the evolution of these models?

\textbf{A10.}\\
- \textbf{Simple Explanation}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For centuries, everyone thought \textbf{everything} revolved around \textbf{Earth}.
    \item Copernicus proposed a radical change: \textbf{we} (Earth) revolve around the \textbf{Sun}.
    \item This explained complicated planetary motions more simply and \textbf{shifted} our sense of our place in the universe.
  \end{itemize}
- \textbf{Important Takeaway}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Scientific understanding can \textbf{radically change} when new data and simpler explanations contradict old assumptions.
    \item It highlights the \textbf{power of observation}, \textbf{mathematical modeling}, and the willingness to challenge deeply held beliefs.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Positions on the Celestial Sphere}

\subsection{Why We Need Celestial Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Observational Reference Frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Although we know the universe isn’t geocentric, we \emph{observe} from Earth.
    \item Earth’s rotations and revolutions constantly change the apparent positions of celestial objects.
    \item We need a stable coordinate system that doesn’t change too much with Earth’s daily and yearly motions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Altitude--Azimuth (Horizon) Coordinate System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Altitude (h)}: Angle above the local horizon.
    \item \textbf{Azimuth (A)}: Angle measured along the horizon eastward from north to the great circle passing through the object and the observer’s zenith.
    \item \textbf{Zenith}: The point on the celestial sphere directly overhead the observer.
    \item \textbf{Zenith distance (z)}: \(z = 90^\circ - h\).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Limitations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Location-Dependent}: Coordinates change if you move to another latitude/longitude.
    \item \textbf{Time-Dependent}: Because of Earth’s rotation, star positions in this system change hour to hour and day to day.
    \item Converting horizon coordinates from one place/time to another is complicated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Daily and Seasonal Changes in the Sky}

\subsubsection{Daily (Diurnal) Motion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Earth rotates once in $\sim$24 hours, making the stars \emph{appear} to travel east $\rightarrow$ west across the sky.
  \item In reality, we’re rotating west $\rightarrow$ east.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Annual Motion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Earth completes an \emph{orbit} around the Sun in $\sim$365.26 days.
  \item The \textbf{Sun} appears to move through the \textbf{ecliptic} (the path across constellations like Virgo, Orion, Aquarius, Scorpius).
  \item Different constellations are visible at night in different seasons.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Solar vs.\ Sidereal Day}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Solar day}: $\sim$24 hours, from one \emph{noon} (Sun on the meridian) to the next.
  \item \textbf{Sidereal day}: $\sim$23 hours 56 minutes, based on a star’s return to the meridian.
  \item Earth rotates about 361$^\circ$ in a solar day vs.\ 360$^\circ$ in a sidereal day (the extra 1$^\circ$ is due to Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Seasons}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Caused by the 23.5$^\circ$ tilt of Earth’s axis relative to the \emph{ecliptic plane}.
  \item \textbf{Summer} in Northern Hemisphere: Sun is north of the celestial equator $\rightarrow$ longer days, higher Sun altitude $\rightarrow$ warmer.
  \item \textbf{Winter} in Northern Hemisphere: Sun is south of the celestial equator $\rightarrow$ shorter days, lower Sun altitude.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Equatorial Coordinate System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Basic Idea}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analogy to Earth’s \emph{latitude} and \emph{longitude}, but projected onto the \emph{celestial sphere} and \emph{not} rotating with Earth.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Declination ($\delta$)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analogous to \emph{latitude} (in degrees).
    \item 0$^\circ$ at the celestial equator, +90$^\circ$ at north celestial pole, $-$90$^\circ$ at south celestial pole.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Right Ascension ($\alpha$)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analogous to \emph{longitude}, measured eastward along the celestial equator from the vernal equinox ($\Upsilon$).
    \item Typically given in \emph{hours}, \emph{minutes}, and \emph{seconds}; 24h = 360$^\circ$, so 1h = 15$^\circ$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Vernal Equinox}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator going northward (around March 20).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stability}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item RA and Dec \emph{do not} depend on the observer’s location.
    \item They don’t change with Earth’s daily rotation or annual revolution (neglecting slow precession).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Precession}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A slow \emph{wobble} of Earth’s rotation axis caused by gravitational pulls (primarily the Sun and Moon) on Earth’s equatorial bulge.
    \item Analogous to a \emph{spinning top}’s wobble.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Effects}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item One full precession cycle takes $\sim$25{,}770 years.
    \item The north celestial pole slowly traces a circle in the sky; hence, \emph{Polaris} won’t always be our ``North Star.''
    \item The vernal equinox drifts westward along the ecliptic by $\sim$50.26 arcseconds/year.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Implication for Coordinates}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Right ascension and declination of stars \emph{change slowly} over centuries.
    \item Celestial coordinates must be specified for a \textbf{reference date} (an epoch, e.g.\ J2000.0).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measurements of Time}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Gregorian Calendar}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Civil calendar in common use, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII (1582).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Julian Date (JD)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Counts the days (and fractional days) from noon, Jan 1, 4713\,\textsc{b.c.} (Julian calendar).
    \item Example: \textbf{J2000.0} corresponds to JD 2451545.0 (noon UT, Jan 1, 2000).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Modified Julian Date (MJD)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item MJD = JD $- 2{,}400{,}000.5$ (starts the count at \emph{midnight} instead of noon).
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Heliocentric Julian Date (HJD)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Corrects for light travel time to the \emph{Sun’s center} instead of Earth.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Terrestrial Time (TT)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Adjusts for relativistic effects of Earth’s motion and rotation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Archaeoastronomy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Interdisciplinary field combining \emph{archaeology} and \emph{astronomy}.
    \item Analyzes ancient structures for astronomical alignments and uses knowledge of \emph{precession} to determine the sky’s appearance in the past.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Great Pyramid at Giza (ca.\ 2600\,b.c.)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Aligned extremely accurately to cardinal directions: max error only a few arcminutes.
    \item ``Air shafts'' once aligned with stars:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item One pointed to \emph{Orion’s belt} (Osiris for Egyptians).
      \item Another to \emph{Thuban} (the ``North Star'' at the time).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Significance}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Many ancient cultures built monuments with clear \emph{astronomical} alignments.
    \item Some might be coincidental, but many are definitely intentional.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Practice Questions and Answers}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Why do we still use Earth-centered coordinates if we know the universe is not geocentric?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} Practically, all our observations (except space probes) are from Earth’s surface. We need a convenient local reference to describe directions in the sky. Even though Earth isn’t the center of the universe, it is the center of our observing frame.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{What are altitude and azimuth, and why are they location- and time-dependent?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Altitude (h)} is the angle above the local horizon.
      \item \textbf{Azimuth (A)} is the angle measured along the horizon from north, moving eastward.
    \end{itemize}
    They depend on the observer’s latitude/longitude and also change as Earth rotates, so star positions in this system vary by hour and by observer’s location.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{What causes the 4-minute difference between a solar day and a sidereal day?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} Earth orbits the Sun, so each day it must rotate $\sim$1$^\circ$ more than 360$^\circ$ for the Sun to return to the meridian. For distant stars, only 360$^\circ$ is needed. Thus, a sidereal day is about 4 minutes shorter than a solar day.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{How does Earth’s axial tilt lead to seasons?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} The 23.5$^\circ$ tilt means that for about half of the year, the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun (summer in the north, winter in the south), and six months later, the Southern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun. This affects the Sun’s declination, the length of daylight, and the intensity of sunlight.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Compare the Equatorial Coordinate System to the Horizon System. Which is more ``universal'' and why?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Equatorial} (RA/Dec): Based on the celestial equator and vernal equinox; coordinates for stars remain nearly constant (ignoring slow precession).
      \item \textbf{Horizon} (Alt/Az): Based on local altitude and azimuth, changes with observer location and Earth’s rotation.
    \end{itemize}
    The equatorial system is more universal because it doesn’t depend on an observer’s location or the time of day.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{What is precession, and how does it affect coordinates like RA and Dec over long periods?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} Precession is the slow wobble of Earth’s axis over $\sim$25{,}770 years. It shifts the celestial poles and the vernal equinox, causing right ascension and declination of stars to change slowly. Astronomers must specify an epoch (e.g.\ J2000.0) for precise coordinates.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{What are the Julian Date (JD) and Modified Julian Date (MJD), and why do astronomers use them?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Julian Date (JD)} is the continuous count of days (and fractions) from noon, Jan 1, 4713\,B.C.
      \item \textbf{Modified Julian Date (MJD)} = JD $- 2{,}400{,}000.5$, which starts at midnight.
    \end{itemize}
    Astronomers use them to avoid complexities like leap years and calendar changes, ensuring a straightforward numeric time system.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{How does archaeoastronomy use knowledge of precession? Give an example.}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} Archaeoastronomers reconstruct how the sky looked in ancient times by accounting for precession. Example: The Great Pyramid’s ``air shafts'' once aligned with Orion’s belt and Thuban. This only makes sense if we include the shift in Earth’s pole over thousands of years.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Why is the vernal equinox used as a reference point for right ascension?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} It’s the location where the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving northward (around March 20). It provides a consistent yearly reference for measuring RA along the celestial equator and ties the coordinate system to the seasonal cycle.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{If Polaris is our ``North Star'' today, will it always be? Explain briefly.}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Answer:} No. Due to precession, Earth’s axis traces a circle in the sky over $\sim$25{,}770 years. In about 13,000 years, Vega will be closer to the pole, so Polaris will no longer be the North Star.

\section{Structured Overview}

\subsection{1. The Effects of Motions Through the Heavens}

\subsubsection{1.1 Intrinsic Velocities of Celestial Objects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Besides Earth’s motions (precession, rotation, revolution), stars themselves have \textbf{proper motion}---they are not truly fixed.
  \item Planets, the Sun, and the Moon have more noticeable movements, but stars also move, just more slowly from our perspective.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.2 Radial and Transverse Velocity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A star’s velocity $\mathbf{v}$ relative to an observer can be split into two components:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Radial velocity} $v_r$: Along the line of sight.
    \item \textbf{Transverse (tangential) velocity} $v_\theta$: Perpendicular to the line of sight, producing a star’s proper motion on the celestial sphere.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.3 Proper Motion ($\mu$)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Defined as the star’s angular change in position per unit time, usually in arcseconds per year.
  \item Relation to transverse velocity:
  \[
    \mu \;=\; \frac{d\theta}{dt} \;=\; \frac{v_\theta}{r},
  \]
  where $r$ is the star’s distance from the observer (Equation 5 in the text).
  \item Even if a star’s actual speed is very large, its great distance usually makes the observable angular shift quite small.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2. An Application of Spherical Trigonometry}

\subsubsection{2.1 Spherical Triangles}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A spherical triangle has sides that are great-circle arcs on a sphere.
  \item Standard spherical trig laws:
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Law of sines:}& \quad \frac{\sin a}{\sin A} \;=\;\frac{\sin b}{\sin B} \;=\;\frac{\sin c}{\sin C}, \\
    \text{Law of cosines (sides):}& \quad \cos a \;=\;\cos b\,\cos c \;+\;\sin b\,\sin c\,\cos A, \\
    \text{Law of cosines (angles):}& \quad \cos A \;=\;-\cos B\,\cos C \;+\;\sin B\,\sin C\,\cos a.
  \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2.2 Relating Changes in RA/Dec to Proper Motion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Figure~17 (in the text) shows a star moving from point $A$ to $B$ over a small angle $\Delta \theta$.
  \item Let $\phi$ = the position angle of the star’s motion (angle measured from the north celestial pole direction).
  \item Derived small-angle approximations:
  \[
    \Delta \alpha \;=\; \Delta \theta\,\frac{\sin \phi}{\cos \delta}, 
    \quad
    \Delta \delta \;=\; \Delta \theta\,\cos \phi.
  \]
  \item Combining them gives:
  \[
    (\Delta \theta)^2 \;=\; (\Delta \alpha \,\cos\delta)^2 \;+\; (\Delta \delta)^2.
  \]
  \item These formulas link the total angular change $\Delta \theta$ on the celestial sphere to changes in right ascension $\Delta \alpha$ and declination $\Delta \delta$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{3. Physics and Astronomy}

\subsubsection{3.1 From Mathematical Models to Physical Causes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item After Copernicus and Kepler provided geometrical models, the next step was understanding the physical reasons behind planetary and stellar motions.
  \item \textbf{Astrophysics} = applying physics (mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum theory, relativity, etc.) to interpret astronomical observations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3.2 Role of Various Physics Subfields}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Particle physics \& cosmology}: Study of the Big Bang, fundamental forces, and particles.
  \item \textbf{Nuclear physics}: Explains stellar energy production (fusion in stars).
  \item \textbf{Atomic physics}: Key for spectra of atoms, emission/absorption lines in stars.
  \item \textbf{Condensed-matter physics}: Relevant in extreme objects like neutron star crusts or giant planet interiors.
  \item \textbf{Thermodynamics}: Governs everything from star formation to the Big Bang.
  \item \textbf{Electronics \& detectors}: Enables advanced telescopes (X-ray, gamma-ray, radio, etc.) and space-based observatories.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3.3 Advances in Tools}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modern telescopes detect across all wavelengths (radio $\rightarrow$ gamma).
  \item Space-based telescopes avoid atmospheric interference.
  \item Particle detectors (deep underground) detect cosmic rays, neutrinos, etc.
  \item Computers allow detailed numerical simulations (stars, galaxies, cosmological models).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3.4 Intellectual Adventure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Astronomy is driven by human curiosity: understanding the universe is the ultimate goal.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4. Celestial Mechanics}

\subsubsection{4.1 Elliptical Orbits}

\paragraph{4.1.1 Historical Context}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Tycho Brahe} (1546--1601): Greatest naked-eye observer; measured celestial positions to better than $\frac{1}{8}$ Moon diameter ($\sim 4$ arcminutes).
  \item Discovered comets were far beyond the Moon and observed the supernova of 1572, challenging the notion of an unchanging heavens.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4.1.2 Kepler’s Laws}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Johannes Kepler} (1571--1630): Used Tycho’s data and concluded orbits are elliptical, not circular.
  \item \textbf{First Law:} A planet orbits the Sun in an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus.
  \item \textbf{Second Law:} A line connecting planet and Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times (planet speeds up near perihelion, slows near aphelion).
  \item \textbf{Third Law (``Harmonic Law'')}:
  \[
    P^2 \;=\; a^3,
  \]
  where $P$ = orbital period (in years), $a$ = semimajor axis (in AU).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4.1.3 Ellipse Geometry}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ellipse defined by the sum of distances to two foci being constant: $r + r' = 2a$.
  \item Semimajor axis $a$, semiminor axis $b$.
  \item \textbf{Eccentricity} $e$: (distance between foci) / $2a$.
  \item Perihelion (closest) = $a(1 - e)$; aphelion (farthest) = $a(1 + e)$.
  \item Circle is a special case with $e=0$.
  \item Ellipses, parabolas ($e=1$), and hyperbolas ($e>1$) are conic sections.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{4.2 Newtonian Mechanics}

\paragraph{4.2.1 Galileo Galilei (1564--1642)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Father of modern experimental physics:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Concept of inertia, constant acceleration of falling bodies, telescope observations.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Observed phases of Venus, sunspots, craters on the Moon, and discovered Jupiter’s moons---strong evidence for heliocentrism.
  \item Clashed with the Church; \emph{Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems} led to house arrest.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4.2.2 Isaac Newton (1642--1727)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In \emph{Principia} (1687), formulated:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Three Laws of Motion}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item First Law (Inertia): A body at rest or uniform motion remains so unless a net external force acts.
      \item Second Law: $F_{\text{net}} = m\,a$ or $F_{\text{net}} = \frac{dp}{dt}$.
      \item Third Law: For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Law of Universal Gravitation}
    \[
      F \;=\; G\,\frac{M\,m}{r^2},
    \]
    where $G \approx 6.673 \times 10^{-11}\,\text{N\,m}^2\,\text{kg}^{-2}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4.2.3 Deriving Gravity from Kepler’s Third Law}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Newton showed Kepler’s laws imply a $1/r^2$ force law.
  \item Gravity is universal---affects all masses (planets, apples, stars, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4.2.4 Local Gravity ($g$)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Near Earth’s surface,
  \[
    g \;=\; G\,\frac{M_{\oplus}}{R_{\oplus}^2} \;\approx\; 9.8\,\text{m/s}^2.
  \]
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4.2.5 The Orbit of the Moon}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Newton used the Moon’s nearly circular orbit to show it is kept in orbit by the same gravity that causes an apple to fall.
  \item Moon’s centripetal acceleration $a_c$ matches the gravitational pull from Earth’s $M_{\oplus}$, validating universal gravitation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Practice Questions and Answers}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Why do we split a star’s velocity into radial and transverse components, and how is proper motion defined?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    Splitting velocity clarifies which part is toward/away from us (radial, measured by Doppler shift) vs.\ sideways across the sky (transverse).
    Proper motion is the star’s angular motion on the celestial sphere per unit time, often in arcseconds/year.

  \item \textbf{What is the formula linking transverse velocity $v_\theta$ to proper motion $\mu$?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      \mu \;=\; \frac{d\theta}{dt} \;=\;\frac{v_\theta}{r},
    \]
    where $r$ is the distance to the star.

  \item \textbf{Why do we use spherical trigonometry (instead of plane geometry) to track changes in right ascension and declination?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    Because RA and Dec are coordinates on the celestial sphere, which is a curved surface. Spherical triangles accurately describe the arcs on a sphere. For very small angles, plane approximations work (e.g.\ $\sin\theta \approx \theta$).

  \item \textbf{Briefly restate Kepler’s Three Laws of Planetary Motion.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Planets orbit the Sun in ellipses, with the Sun at one focus.
      \item A line between a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times (the planet's speed varies).
      \item $P^2 = a^3$ (period squared equals semimajor axis cubed), assuming $P$ in years, $a$ in AU.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{How does eccentricity ($e$) define the shape of an ellipse, and what are perihelion and aphelion distances in terms of $a$ and $e$?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    Eccentricity $e$ ($0 \le e < 1$) measures how stretched the ellipse is (circle if $e=0$).
    Perihelion = $a\,(1 - e)$; aphelion = $a\,(1 + e)$.

  \item \textbf{Name Galileo’s key telescopic discoveries that supported heliocentrism.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    Phases of Venus, moons of Jupiter, sunspots (showing Sun’s rotation), lunar craters, and the Milky Way as countless stars. All contradicted the idea of a ``perfect'' geocentric cosmos.

  \item \textbf{State Newton’s Three Laws of Motion in your own words.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Inertia: Objects remain at rest or move in a straight line at constant speed unless acted on by a net force.
      \item $F = m\,a$: A net force causes acceleration proportional to the mass.
      \item Action--Reaction: Every force on one body is matched by an equal and opposite force on another body.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Write the formula for Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation and define $G$.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      F \;=\; G \,\frac{M\,m}{r^2},
    \]
    where $G \approx 6.673\times 10^{-11}\,\text{N\,m}^2\,\text{kg}^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant.

  \item \textbf{How does Kepler’s Third Law imply an inverse-square law of gravity?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    By expressing the planet’s orbital period in terms of orbital radius and comparing the required centripetal force ($m\,v^2/r$) to the relationship $P^2 \propto r^3$, Newton deduced that the force must vary as $1/r^2$.

  \item \textbf{How did Newton show the Moon is held in orbit by the same gravity that affects falling objects on Earth?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    By calculating the Moon’s centripetal acceleration based on its orbital radius and period, he found it matched Earth’s gravitational force at that distance (the $1/r^2$ law). This demonstrated that orbital motion and falling objects share the same gravitational cause.

\section{Structured Overview}

\subsection{1. Work and Energy}

\subsubsection{1.1 Importance of Energy Arguments in Astrophysics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Understanding energy budgets helps determine if certain astrophysical processes can produce observed energies.
  \item Example: Whether a component of a planetary atmosphere can escape depends on the escape speed and the kinetic energy of gas particles.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.2 Gravitational Potential Energy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The work needed to move a mass $m$ from one point to another in a gravitational field is the change in gravitational potential energy $\Delta U$.
  \item For a mass $m$ at distance $r$ from a larger mass $M$, if we set $U \to 0$ at $r \to \infty$, then
  \[
    U \;=\; -\,G\,\frac{M\,m}{r}.
  \]
  \item The force is found by taking the negative gradient of $U$:
  \[
    F \;=\; -\,\nabla U 
    \quad \text{or} \quad 
    F \;=\; -\,\frac{\partial U}{\partial r}.
  \]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.3 Kinetic Energy and the Work--Energy Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Kinetic Energy ($K$) of a mass $m$ with speed $v$:
  \[
    K \;=\; \tfrac{1}{2}\,m\,v^2.
  \]
  \item The work done on an object changes its kinetic energy ($W = \Delta K$).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.4 Escape Speed}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The speed needed to escape (reach $r \to \infty$ with final $v=0$) from a mass $M$ starting at radius $r$.
  \item By energy conservation ($E_{\text{total}} = 0$ at infinity):
  \[
    \frac{1}{2}\,m\,v_{\text{esc}}^2 
    \;=\;
    G\,\frac{M\,m}{r}
    \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
    v_{\text{esc}}
    \;=\;
    \sqrt{\frac{2\,G\,M}{r}}.
  \]
  \item Near Earth’s surface, $v_{\text{esc}} \approx 11.2\,\text{km/s}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2. Kepler’s Laws Derived (Newtonian Approach)}

\subsubsection{2.1 Center-of-Mass Frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In a two-body problem (masses $m_1, m_2$), it is convenient to use the center of mass (COM) frame.
  \item Position of COM:
  \[
    \mathbf{R}
    \;=\;
    \frac{m_1\,\mathbf{r}_1 \;+\; m_2\,\mathbf{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2}.
  \]
  \item Define the \textbf{reduced mass} $\mu$:
  \[
    \mu 
    \;\equiv\;
    \frac{m_1\,m_2}{m_1 + m_2}.
  \]
  \item The two-body orbit can be mapped to one mass $\mu$ orbiting at distance $r$ around a total mass $M = m_1 + m_2$ at the origin.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2.2 Kepler’s First Law (General Form)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Newton showed that a gravitational $1/r^2$ force produces conic-section orbits: ellipse (bound), parabola (marginally unbound), hyperbola (unbound).
  \item Elliptical Orbits have negative total energy ($E < 0$).
  \item In the COM frame, the orbit of the reduced mass $\mu$ satisfies:
  \[
    r(\theta)
    \;=\;
    \frac{\ell^2/\mu}{\,G\,M\,}\,\bigl[\,1 \;+\; e\,\cos(\theta)\bigr],
  \]
  where $\ell = |\mathbf{L}|$ is the orbital angular momentum, and $e$ is the eccentricity.
  \item For closed (elliptical) orbits, each mass revolves around the COM in its own ellipse, with the COM at one focus.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2.3 Kepler’s Second Law}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A line from the focus to the orbiting body sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
  \item From angular momentum conservation,
  \[
    \frac{dA}{dt}
    \;=\;
    \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\ell}{\mu}
    \;=\;\text{constant},
  \]
  meaning the area rate ($\dot{A}$) is constant.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2.4 Kepler’s Third Law}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For an elliptical orbit, the period $P$ and semimajor axis $a$ obey:
  \[
    P^2
    \;=\;
    \frac{4\,\pi^2}{G\,(m_1 + m_2)}\,a^3.
  \]
  \item If $(m_1 + m_2) \approx m_{\text{central}}$ is very large (e.g.\ the Sun), it reduces to Kepler’s simpler form $P^2 = a^3$.
  \item Essential for deriving masses in binary systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2.5 Orbital Energy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Total orbital energy:
  \[
    E
    \;=\;
    \tfrac{1}{2}\,\mu\,v^2
    \;-\;
    G\,\frac{m_1\,m_2}{r},
  \]
  which can be rearranged (for an elliptical orbit) to:
  \[
    E
    \;=\;
    -\,\frac{G\,m_1\,m_2}{\,2\,a\,}.
  \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{3. The Virial Theorem}

\subsubsection{3.1 Definition \& Statement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For a gravitationally bound system in equilibrium, time-averaged total kinetic energy $\langle K\rangle$ and potential energy $\langle U\rangle$ satisfy:
  \[
    \langle U\rangle
    \;=\;
    -\,2\,\langle K\rangle
    \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
    \langle E_{\text{total}}\rangle
    \;=\;
    \langle K\rangle + \langle U\rangle
    \;=\;
    \tfrac12\,\langle U\rangle.
  \]
  \item This is the \textbf{Virial Theorem}. For a stable, self-gravitating system, total energy $E$ is negative and is half the potential energy (in magnitude).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3.2 Applications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Binary orbits}: We saw $E = \tfrac12\,\langle U\rangle$.
  \item \textbf{Stars}: In hydrostatic equilibrium, a star’s gravitational collapse leads to half the lost gravitational potential energy appearing as internal energy (heat, radiation).
  \item \textbf{Galaxy clusters}: Astronomers use the virial theorem to estimate cluster mass from galaxy velocities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Practice Questions and Answers}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Define gravitational potential energy for a mass $m$ at distance $r$ from a larger mass $M$.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      U(r)
      \;=\;
      -\,G\,\frac{M\,m}{r},
    \]
    assuming $U \to 0$ as $r \to \infty$.

  \item \textbf{What is the expression for escape speed from a planet of mass $M$, starting at radius $r$?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      v_{\text{esc}}
      \;=\;
      \sqrt{\frac{2\,G\,M}{r}}.
    \]
    Derived by setting total energy to zero at infinity.

  \item \textbf{How do you write the total mechanical energy $E$ of a mass $m$ in a gravitational field (ignoring other forces)?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      E
      \;=\;
      K + U
      \;=\;
      \tfrac12\,m\,v^2
      \;-\;
      G\,\frac{M\,m}{r}.
    \]

  \item \textbf{Explain why we use the reduced mass $\mu$ in a two-body problem.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    It converts a 2-body problem into an equivalent single-body problem, where a mass
    \(
      \mu
      =
      \frac{m_1\,m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
    \)
    orbits the total mass $(m_1 + m_2)$. It greatly simplifies the math.

  \item \textbf{State Newton’s general form of Kepler’s Third Law.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      P^2
      \;=\;
      \frac{4\,\pi^2}{G\,(m_1 + m_2)}\,a^3.
    \]

  \item \textbf{If the total orbital energy of a planet--star system is negative, what does that imply about their orbit?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    Negative total energy means the orbit is bound and thus \emph{elliptical}.

  \item \textbf{Show how Kepler’s Second Law arises from angular momentum conservation.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    The area swept out per unit time is
    \(
      \frac{dA}{dt}
      =
      \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{\ell}{\mu}.
    \)
    Because $\ell$ (angular momentum) is constant under a central force, $dA/dt$ is constant, implying ``equal areas in equal times.''

  \item \textbf{In terms of $a$ and $e$, what are the perihelion and aphelion distances in an elliptical orbit?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    Perihelion: $r_p = a\,(1 - e)$; \quad
    Aphelion: $r_a = a\,(1 + e)$.

  \item \textbf{State the Virial Theorem for a gravitationally bound system.}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    \[
      \langle U\rangle
      \;=\;
      -\,2\,\langle K\rangle
      \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
      \langle E_{\mathrm{total}}\rangle
      \;=\;
      \tfrac12\,\langle U\rangle.
    \]
    The total energy is negative and half the potential energy in magnitude.

  \item \textbf{How does the virial theorem explain the energy release during the gravitational collapse of a star?}\\
    \emph{Answer:}\\
    As the star collapses, its potential energy $U$ becomes more negative. By the virial theorem, the system must lose energy (radiate away or convert to heat) to reach equilibrium, so roughly half the decrease in $U$ shows up as internal/radiative energy.
